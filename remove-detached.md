Introduction
============

The current version of P2300 includes two algorithms that operate on senders, `start_detached()` and `ensure_started()`
which provide functionality that enables sender-based operations to be launched eagerly, allowing them to run in the
background.

However, the current design of these facilities would introduce major footguns in the standard library
as they are deceptively enticing yet difficult to use correctly, making it much harder to guarantee
code safely cleans up resources used by the eagerly launched operations.

The paper [P3149R1] proposes an alternative async-scope facility that provides the ability to launch
work eagerly while still retaining the ability to later join the completion of that work, allowing
cleanup to still be performed safely.

This paper proposes that the `start_detached()` and `ensure_started()` facilities be removed
from P2300 before it is merged into the working draft.

`ensure_started`
================

Senders are generally assumed to be safe to destroy at any point. It is common to have algorithms that compose senders but that do not guarantee to connect/start their child senders, whether due to exceptions or some short-circuiting behaviour of the algorithm.

However, `ensure_started()` returns a sender that owns work that is potentially already executing asynchronously in the background.

If this `ensure_started()` sender is destroyed without being connected/started then we need to specify the semantics of what will happen to that already-started asynchronous work. There are four common strategies for what to do in this case:

1. Block in the destructor until the asynchronous operation completes - can easily lead to deadlock.
1. Detaching from the async operation, letting it run to completion in the background - makes it hard to implement clean shut-down as you don't necessarily know when resources used by the async operation can be safely destroyed.
1. Treat it as undefined-behavior.
1. Terminate the program - the strategy that `std::thread` takes.
  
The current `ensure_started()` wording chooses option 2 as the least worst option, but all of the options are generally bad options.

The `ensure_started()` facility is especially dangerous as the returned sender is much more likely to be
composed with sender adaptors into other operations and work most of the time, but introduce non-obvious
data races that may only occur on failure-codepaths.

The functionality previously provided by `std::execution::ensure_started()`, which allows eagerly starting
an operation and then later observing the result, can be obtained by using facilities proposed by [P3149].

Instead of writing:
```c++
std::execution::ensure_started(sender)
```
you would write:
```c++
std::execution::spawn_future(scope, sender)
```
where `scope` is some `std::execution::counting_scope` object.

If the sender returned by `spawn_future()` is destroyed before it is connected/started then a stop request
is sent and the sender detaches from the operation.

The operation can still then complete asynchronously in the background and can be later joined using the
`scope.join()` facility on the `counting_scope` object.

This allows callers to wait until any eagerly launched operation completes and stops accessing
resources and thus can safely sequence destruction of those resources to occur after all uses.

`start_detached`
================

Like `ensure_started()`, the `start_detached()` facility allows you to eagerly launch
an async operation in the background, only without returning a sender that can be used
to later join the work.

This has the same challenges as `ensure_started()` with regards to support for safe
cleanup of resources used by the launched operations.

However, it's slightly less dangerous than `ensure_started()` because it has a scarier name
and does not return a value that users might mistakenly think they can safely compose with
other algorithms.

It still requires other out-of-band mechanisms for joining the detached work before you can
safely destroy resources used by the detached operations are destroyed.
For example, by using ad-hoc GC such as shared_ptr or other synchronization primitives.

The functionality provided by `start_detached(s)` can be provided instead using an async scope
by calling `std::execution::spawn(scope, s)` for some async-scope, `scope`.

Proposal
========

Remove `ensure_started` and `start_detached` from [@P2300R7] by removing the following sections.

::: rm

> | 
> | execution::sender auto ensure_started(
> |     execution::sender auto sender
> | );
> | 
> | Once ensure_started returns, it is known that the provided sender has been connected 
> | and `start` has been called on the resulting operation state (see § 5.2 Operation 
> | states represent work); in other words, the work described by the provided sender 
> | has been submitted for execution on the appropriate execution resources. Returns a 
> | sender which completes when the provided sender completes and sends values equivalent 
> | to those of the provided sender.
> | 
> | If the returned sender is destroyed before `execution::connect()` is called, or if
> | `execution::connect()` is called but the returned operation-state is destroyed before 
> | `execution::start()` is called, then a stop-request is sent to the eagerly launched
